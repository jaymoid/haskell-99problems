# Haskell 99 problems

A Stack project with automated tests for the [Haskell 99 problems](https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems).

## Running the tests
1. Clone the repo
2. `stack test`

## I need help...
Please feel free to contribute to the tests. I've made a start.

The `unsolved` branch is for the tests and placeholder function implementations.

## Solve the problems yourself
Switch to the `solutions` branch to solve the problems yourself.

*Please don't  contribute your solutions here (there's plenty available here: https://wiki.haskell.org/99_questions/Solutions), maybe you could fork this repo to track your own solutions.*

Happy Haskell Hacking!
